# Operation B.L.A.S.T.

This is our final graduation team project for Full Sail University created back in 2011.

Description
---
Operation BLAST is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up where Barron and Claire shoot their way through an endless army of robots, wreaking havoc and trying to beat each other's score for most kills. Utilize weapons with alternate firing modes, and unleash devastating ultimate attacks to wreck more bots than your opponent.
